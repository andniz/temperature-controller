# Temperature controller for homebrewing

This part of the application is supposed to only receive the information about the ongoing 
fermentation's temperature profile and turn actuators on/off.

It should make the decision basing only on fermentation profile and actuators' current state.

It's separate from the controlling web app to make sure it's properly decoupled.
